COP 4930    Python Programming

Assignment 05


Please write a function called main( ) that reads the lines in
the file bib.txt. Each line may have leading blanks.
After the possible leading blanks there is a command like

    \bibitem
    \A
    \B
    etc.
as in the input file bib.txt
If the line begins with \bibitem, display
    <doi>
If the line is a blank line, display
    </doi>
to indicate the end of the doi (digital object identification).
The last line of bib.txt is a blank line.

Please write a second function commands( ) that accepts an input
line main( ) read from bib.txt:

    def commands( line ) :

The function commands( ) has to use a dictionary where the keys (indices)
are commands like "\\A", "\\Y", "\\B", etc. as they appear in bib.txt
and the corresponding values should be "author", "year", "book", etc.

commands( line ) has to
    o   remove trailing periods or commas that may appear in line
    o   display "+++ unknown:" followed by the input line to flag
        unknown commands;
        an unknown command is any command other than \A, \B, \R, \P,
        \J, and \Y

Remember that any command, like \A, has to appear as "\\A" in your
program because a backslash (\) is an escape sequence; when you need
to match a backslash you have to use two backslashes.

Please see lab05.out that contains the output when we run our program
with the sample input file bib.txt


Penalties:
    o no credit if your .py file does not run
    o no credit if you do NOT use a Python dictionary
    o no credit if you do NOT read the input file bib.txt
    o no credit if your .py file does not produce the correct results
      similar to what we produced in lab05.out for the sample input
      file bib.txt
    o no credit if you do not create two functions as described; you may
      create more than the two functions we asked you to write
    o no credit for late assignments


Please upload to the BlackBoard a .py file named

    YourFAUID_lab05.py

and the header information you received for in labs 1 and 2.
Do not submit .txt or .out files.
