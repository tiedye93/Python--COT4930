COP 4930    Python Programming

Assignment 02


Please read about the Fibonacci numbers at

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

then write a program, and save it in lab02.py, that asks how many
numbers it should generate in the Fibonacci series.
Remember that the first two numbers are

    0 and 1

so you already have two numbers in the series when you start.
If the user asks for 4 numbers, your program should produce

    0    1    1    2

Please use five positions when you display each value of the
Fibonacci series and display six values per line. That means
if the user asked for 9 values your program should display

    0    1    1    2    3    5
    8   13   21

Use a Python list to store the numbers.
Print the numbers only after you create the list with as
many Fibonacci numbers as the user asked for.
Assume the user will NOT ask for less than 2 numbers and
no more than 20 numbers.


Please use a heading for your assignments like

Penalties:
    o no credit if your .py file does not run
    o no credit if you  do NOT use a Python list
    o no credit if your .py file does not produce the correct results
      as listed above
    o no credit for late assignments

Each lab is due one week after it is assigned.
Your solution has to be available in the BlackBoard
no later than 11:59PM on the day it is due.
It is acceptable to submit your assignment more than
once. We will look only at your last version of the lab.


Please upload to the BlackBoard a .py file named
