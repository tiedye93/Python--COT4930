COP 4930    Python Programming

Assignment 08


Please write a function called main( ) that reads one of the .tex input
available in the folder called files.

For example, files/re4.tex contains

    This is an itemized list:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item one
    \item two
    \end{itemize}

That is the LaTeX file that produced pdf/re4.pdf
You can open a pdf file using Adobe Reader.
Your program should convert a LaTeX file like files/re4.tex that produced
pdf/re4.pdf and convert it to HTML. That is, your program needs to read
files/re4.tex and produce files/re4.html

You can click on files/re4.html to see that the output is equivalent to
the one in pdf/re4.pdf

Your program should handle the following LaTeX commands and convert them
to HTML:
    LaTeX                   HTML

    \chapter{ ... }         <H1> ... </H1>
    \section{ ... }         <H2> ... </H2>
    \subsection{ ... }      <H3> ... </H3>

    \begin{description}     <DL>
    \item[xxxx] something   <DD>xxxx something</DD>
    \end{description}       </DL>

    \begin{itemize}         <UL>
    \item something         <LI>something</LI>
    \end{itemize}           </UL>

    \verb+'a'+              <TT>'a'</TT>


Penalties:
    o no credit if your .py file does not run
    o no credit if you do NOT read the .tex input files from files; your
      program should read only file at a time
    o no credit if your .py file does not produce the correct results
      similar to what we produced in files/*.html
    o no credit for late assignments


Please upload to the BlackBoard a .py file named

    YourFAUID_lab08.py

and the header information you received for in labs 1 and 2.
Do not submit .tex or .html files.

This assignment is due on Saturday, 11/14, at 11:59PM.
