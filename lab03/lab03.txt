for a list of the prime numbers between 2 and 100.

Please write a program, save it in YourFAUID_lab03.py, that asks for 
an upper range of numbers to search for prime numbers. 
Start at 2 and go up to the number the user asked you to use. 

Your program should make sure that the upper bound when searching for the
prime numbers is >= 2 and <= 300; otherwise your program should display
a message that upper bound is out of range and terminate the execution.

Write a function eratos that takes an int indicating the upper range of
the numbers and returns a list of ints containing the prime numbers
between 2 and n:

    def eratos( n ) :

The algorithm indicates that the first number, 2, is a prime and every
multiple of if cannot be a prime, so "cross them out: 4, 6, 8, etc."
When the algorithm indicates one should "cross out" a number, that is another
way to say "remove that number from the list." 
See the function remove( ) on 5.5.7, p54, textbook.

Write a second function,

	def print_primes( primes ) :

where primes is the list of ints that erators( ) generated.
This function should display 10 numbers per line and use 5 positions 
for each number; if the user asked for an upper bound of 100, 
your program should display

    2    3    5    7   11   13   17   19   23   29
   31   37   41   43   47   53   59   61   67   71
   73   79   83   89   97


Penalties:
    o no credit if your .py file does not run
    o no credit if you do NOT use a Python list
    o no credit if your .py file does not produce the correct results
      as listed above
    o no credit if you do not create two functions as described
    o no credit for late assignments


Please upload to the BlackBoard a .py file named

    YourFAUID_lab03.py
