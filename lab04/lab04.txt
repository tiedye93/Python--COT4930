COP 4930    Python Programming

Assignment 04


Please write a function called make_dict( ) that reads the lines in
the file fl_cities.txt. Each line looks like

    33050:Marathon

where 33050 is the zip code for Marathon. The city name, Marathon, is
the key you need to use in the dictionary.

The second function, test_dict( ), uses the global dictionary you
created in make_dict( ) and reads the lines in the file fl_maint.txt
that maintains the dictionary and finds the zip codes for the cities.
Each line in fl_maint.txt has the format (the field separator is - )

    p-cities            # print the name of the cities in alphabetical
                        # order along with their zip codes

    f-Marathon          # find the zip code for Marathon; it is 33050

    c-33394:Fort Lauderdale
                        # change the zip code for Fort Lauderdale
                        # from the original 33301 to 33394

    anything other than c, f, and p are unknown commands, like

    xyz-cities          # xyz is an unknown command
    xx-cities           # xx  is an unknown command

    Other items to keep in mind:

    f-Orlando           # should display "city unknown" because we do
                        # do not have Orlando and its zip code in the
                        # file fl_cities.txt

    c-99999:Orlando     # should display "city unknown" because the
                        # command is trying to change the zip code for
                        # a city that does not appear in the dictionary

Note that any reasonable number of zip codes and cities may appear
in the fl_cities.txt file.

Note that any number of commands may appear in a file like fl_maint.txt
that we will use to test your code.

Please see lab04.out that contains the output when we run our program
with the sample input file fl_maint.txt


Penalties:
    o no credit if your .py file does not run
    o no credit if you do NOT use a Python dictionary
    o no credit if you do NOT read an input file with the field
      separator : like fl_cities.txt that shows zip code and city name
    o no credit if your .py file does not produce the correct results
      similar to what we produced in lab04.out for the sample input
      file fl_maint.txt
    o no credit if you do not create two functions as described; you may
      create more than the two functions we asked you to write
    o no credit for late assignments


Please upload to the BlackBoard a .py file named

    YourFAUID_lab04.py

and the header information you received for in labs 1 and 2.
Do not submit .txt or .out files.


End of Assignment 04.
