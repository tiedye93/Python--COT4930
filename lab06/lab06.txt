COP 4930    Python Programming

Assignment 06


Please write a function called main( ) that creates an object of type
List and then reads the lines in the file llist.txt.
Each line may have leading or trailing blanks.
After the possible leading blanks there is a command like

    i  abc          # insert the string abc in a linked list
    p               # print a linked list
    r  abc          # remove the node that contains abc the linked list,
                    # if it is present

as in the input file llist.txt
The comments above are not part of the llist.txt file.

Use the class Node we discussed in class.
Modify the insert method in the class List to insert a string in the linked
list while maintaing the list in alphabetical order. Do not invoke any
sorting method to sort the linked list. The insert method should maintain
the linked list sorted at all times.
Add a remove method to the class List to remove the node that contains the
string that follows the r command. If there is no node with the string that
follows the r command, remove should not do anything.

Please see llist.out that contains the output when we run our program
with the sample input file llist.txt


Penalties:
    o no credit if your .py file does not run
    o no credit if you do NOT use the classes Node and List
    o no credit if you do NOT read the input file llist.txt
    o no credit if your .py file does not produce the correct results
      similar to what we produced in llist.out for the sample input
      file llist.txt
    o no credit for late assignments


Please upload to the BlackBoard a .py file named

    YourFAUID_lab06.py

and the header information you received for in labs 1 and 2.
Do not submit .txt or .out files.
